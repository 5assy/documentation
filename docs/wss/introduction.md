# Introduction

Infura's websocket endpoint provides support for Pub/Sub API as well as JSON-RPC filter support.
The regular Ethereum API is also supported and documented in the 'examples' portion of 'Ethereum API'

All examples in this reference section uses WSCAT, but will work with any tool that supports websockets.

Some tools you can use for making these requests
- [WSCAT](https://github.com/websockets/wscat)
- [Advanced Rest Client](https://install.advancedrestclient.com/)
